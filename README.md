# incident-enrichment-app
incident enrichment app that adds weather details to a 911 emergency incident

1. To run, make sure React is installed first. Then clone the repo and run "npm start". Once in the app, use the input fields to give the latitude and longitude of where the event took place, as well as the date and time. This will bring the map toward the area of the incident as well as the weather details gathered within that hour.
2. I spent about 4 hours on this project, while taking small break in the middle to eat.
